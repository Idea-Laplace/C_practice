Write a program that read a date from the command line and displays if
in the following form:

	September 13, 2010

Allow the user to enter the date as either 9-13-2010 or 9/13/2010; you
may assume that there are no spaces in the date. Print an error message
if the date doesn't have one of the specified forms.

HINT: Use sscanf to extract the month, day and year from the command-line
	  argument.
