KNK C programming 2nd edition
chapter 22 project 12, p.587

Modify Programming Project 2 from chapter 3 so that the progrma reads
a series of items from a file and displays the  data in colums. Each
line of the file will have the following form:

	item, princ, mm/dd/yyyy

For example, suppose that the file contains the following lines.

583, 13.5,10,24,2005
3912,599.99,7/27/2008

The output of the program should have the following appearance:

	Item		Unit		Purchase
				Price
	583		$ 13.50			10/24/2005
	3912    $ 599.99		7/27/2008

Have the program obtain the file name from the command line.
