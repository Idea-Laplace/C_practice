K.N.King C programming 2nd edition chapter 22 project 18, p.588

Write a program that reads integers from a text file whose name is 
given as a command line argument. Each line of the file may contain
any number of integers (including none) separated by one or more sp-
-aces. Have the program display the largest number in the file, the
smallest number and the median(the number cloest to the middle if the
integer sorted). If the file contains an even number of integers, there
will be two numbers in the middle; the program should display their av-
-erage(rounded down). You may assume that the file contains no more than
10,000 integers.

Hint: Store the integers in an array and then sort the array.
