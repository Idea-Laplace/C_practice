Let f be the following function. What will be the value of f(10) if f has never
been called before? What will be the value of f(10) if f has been called five
times previously?

int f(int i) {
	static int j = 0;
	return i * j++;
}

first time: f(10) = 10 * 0 = 0
The sixth call of f(10) = 10 * 5 = 50
