(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function f, assuming that it's
declared as follows:

int (*f(float (*)(long), char *))(double);

A function which returns a pointer to a function having double type argument and returning
int value.

The function takes 2 arguments, one is a pointer to a function that takes a long int type,
	and the other is a pointer to char type value.

(b) int n = (*f(fp, str))(3.14159)
