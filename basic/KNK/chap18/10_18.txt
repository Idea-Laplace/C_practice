Write declarations for the following variables and functions:

(a) p is a pointer to a function with a charater pointer argument that returns a character pointer.

	Ans) char *(*p)(char *);

(b) f is a function with 2 arguments: p, a pointer to a structure with tag t, and n, a long integer
	f returns a pointer to a function that has no arguments and returns nothing.

	Ans) void (*f(struct t *p, long n))(void);

(c) a is an array of 4 pointers to functions that have no arguments and return nothing.

	Ans) void (*a[4])(void) = {insert, search, update, print};

(d) b is an array of 10 pointers to functions with 2 int arguments that return structures with tag t.

	Ans) struct t (*b[10])(int, int);
