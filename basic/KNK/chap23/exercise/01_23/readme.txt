K.N.King C programming 2nd ed. chapter23 exercise 1, p.623

Extend the round_nearest function so that it rounds a floating-point number x to n
digits after the decimal point. For example, the call round_nearest(3.14159, 3) w-
-ould return 3.142.

Hint: Multiply x by 10^n, round to the nearest integer, then divide by 10^n, Be s-
ure that your function works correctly for both positive and negative values of x.
