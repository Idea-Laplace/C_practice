Chapter23 project5, p.625

Suppose that money is deposited into a savings account and left for t years.
Assume that the annual interest rate if r and that interest is compounded 
continuously. The formula A(t) = Pe^rt can by usef to calculate the final 
value of the account, where P is the original amount deposited. For exaple,
$1000 left on deposit for 10 years at 6% interest would be worth:

	$1000 * e^(.06 * 10) = $1,822.12;

Write a program that displays the result of this calculation after prompting
the user to enter the original amount deposited, the interst rate, and the
number of years.
