/*
   The following statement si supposed to test whether any of the three
   bits have been set, but it never displays the specified message.
   Explain why the statement doesn't work and show how to fix it.
   Assume key_code is an int variable.

   if (key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT) == 0)
	   printf("No modifier keys pressed.\n");

// It is because the equality operator '==' take precedence over &, ^ or |.
// Hence 0111 == 0 is always done before &, which is always false.
// We can correct it by fixing if ((key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)) == 0)
