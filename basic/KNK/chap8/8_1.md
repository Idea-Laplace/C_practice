# Exercise 8-1 

We discussed using the expression sizeof (a) / sizeof (a[0])   
calculate the number of elements in an array. <br>
The expression sizeof (a) / sizeof (t), where t is the type <br>
if a's elements, would also work, but it's considered an inferior technuique.   
Why?   
1. [was #4] The problem with sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) is that it can't easily be checked for correctness by someone reading the program. (The reader would have to locate the declaration of a and make sure that its elements have type t.)
