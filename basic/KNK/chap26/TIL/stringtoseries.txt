strto...(const char * restrict nptr,
		char ** restrict endptr,
		int base);

nptr: A string you want to convert to a number type.
endptr: endptr points a pointer(say suc_or_fail, end_ptr = &suc_or_fail);
After the function call, the suc_or_fail would point to either *nptr or '\0'.
The former when the coversion failed, the latter when the conversion succeeded.

base literally means base, or radix of number.
